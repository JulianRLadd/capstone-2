## Game Instructions

Place the instructions for how to play your game in this file. The instructions should be clear enough for any non-technical computer user to understand and follow.

Welcome to Classic Checkers!

How to play:

Insert the x-y coordinates of the checker you wish to move.
Afterwards, insert the x-y coordinates of the square you want to move to.
The x coordinates are determined by which numbered column the checker is in from the top, while the y coordinates are determined by the numbered row the checker is on.

Capture the opponents checkers by selecting the square directly behind an enemy's checker that is right next to your own. This is called "jumping".

No double jumps allowed, and there are no forced jumps. Move your checkers to the opponents back row to "king" your checker and grant it the ability to move back and forth along the y-axis.

The game continues until all of the opponents checkers are gone! Have fun!
